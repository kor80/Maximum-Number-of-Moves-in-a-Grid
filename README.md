<h3>LeetCode daily problem 🚀:</h3> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid.

<h3>Problem description 📝:</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a cell (row, col), you can move to any of the cells: 
<ul>
  <li>(row - 1, col + 1)</li>
  <li>(row, col + 1)</li>
  <li>(row + 1, col + 1)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such that the value of the cell you move to, should be strictly bigger than the value of the current cell.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the maximum number of moves that you can perform.
