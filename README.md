Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid.

<h3>Problem description 📝:</h3>
<p>
You are given a 0-indexed m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.
</p>

<p>
You can start at any cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:

From a cell (row, col), you can move to any of the cells: 
- (row - 1, col + 1)
- (row, col + 1)
- (row + 1, col + 1)
such that the value of the cell you move to, should be strictly bigger than the value of the current cell.
